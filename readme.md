A module which draws grid-accurate auras around tokens, which supports any size token and has customisable display styles. Supports the Token Border Supplements (formerly Hex Size Support) module.

## Installation

Simply search for 'Grid-Aware Auras' in the Foundry 'Install Module' screen and install it from there.

Alternatively, paste this URL into the 'Manifest URL' field of the 'Install Module' dialog in the Foundry configuration: `https://github.com/Wibble199/FoundryVTT-Grid-Aware-Auras/releases/latest/download/module.json`, then enable the module in your world.

## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, Grid-Aware Auras ONLY supports hex grids, not square ones yet. Though it is something I intend to add in the near future!

1. First open a token configuration by using the cog button when right-clicking a token on the scene, or open the prototype token configuration for an actor.
2. Then, navigate to the new "Auras" tab, then click the `+` button to create a new aura. You can then set the size of the aura, as well as how you want it to appear to everyone. You can add as many auras as you want!
3. If you need to edit an existing aura, you can click the cog button next to it to edit it. You can also quickly toggle whether that aura is visible by clicking the eye icon.
4. Finally, just click the "Update Token" button.

## Roadmap

Features that I will be looking to add to Grid-Aware Auras in future (in rough order of priority):

- [ ] Square Grid Support
- [ ] Hooks for when other tokens enter/leave an aura (e.g. to allow applying active effects)
- [ ] Per-aura option to only show it under certain circumstances (e.g. only when token selected, only when dragging, only owner, etc.)
- [ ] Formal API for creating/updating/deleting auras on tokens.
- [ ] Allow auras on items, which will get added to the token when owned by that token's actor.
- [ ] Setting auras by active effects (e.g. allowing effects to alter the range of an aura).
